This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for each topic of the course taught by Isa Fulford (OpenAI) and Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI) that describes how LLMs work, provide best practices for prompt engineering, and show how LLM APIs can be used in applications for a variety of tasks, including:

    Summarizing (e.g., summarizing user reviews for brevity)
    Inferring (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction)
    Transforming text (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction)
    Expanding (e.g., automatically writing emails)
